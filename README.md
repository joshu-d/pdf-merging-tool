# Requirements for execution

* Python
* Python Libraries: `PyPDF2` `os`

You can merge multiple PDF files into on PDF using `Python` in 10 lines of code. You need to have your source-code in the same location of your PDF files. If you run the code all single pdf files will be deleted and a new big pdf file will be created. 

```
What does the program do? 
- If executed in the given folder/directory, it will execute a script
- This script will create a new file that holds all the .pdf format files
- Cleans up all the files at the end
```
